# Ising Model Simulation

## Author: Julia Grzegorzewska
 
### Description

Metropolis algorithm for Ising Model without magnetic pole on two-dimensional quadratic grid using Monte Carlo method. Plots present spins configurations, trajectories for different grid sizes, magnetization and  magnetic susceptibility as a functions of temperature. Exact instructions are in file instructions.pdf.
